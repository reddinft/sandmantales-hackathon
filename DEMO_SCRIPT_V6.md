# DEMO_SCRIPT_V6.md — Sandman Tales v2 (2-Minute App Demo)
*Team ClawCutters — Mistral Worldwide Hackathon*

## SCENE 1 — HOOK (Papa Bois, 15s)
**[Screen: Login page — starfield background, Sandman Tales logo]**

"Over a quarter of Australians were born overseas. Millions of kids grow up hearing a second language at home — but that language fades as English takes over. We built Sandman Tales to keep those voices alive."

## SCENE 2 — CREATE A STORY (Anansi, 20s)
**[Screen: Create Story form — Sophie, French selected, prompt filled]**

"Sophie's mum is French. She opens Sandman Tales. Taps the mic — Ogma listens through ElevenLabs Speech-to-Text AND Mistral Voxtral, dual transcription for accuracy. She spoke English, but chose French for Sophie's story. Now watch — I weave the tale."

## SCENE 3 — THE PIPELINE (Firefly, 20s)
**[Screen: Pipeline visualization — 9 nodes lighting up sequentially]**

"Nine agents, one pipeline. Ogma transcribes. Papa Bois orchestrates via the Mistral Agents API. A guardrail checks the content. I take over — Anansi generates the story with Mistral Large, I build the illustrations, Devi handles three audio layers: narration, sound effects, and a lullaby. All ElevenLabs."

## SCENE 4 — PIPELINE COMPLETE (Firefly, 10s)
**[Screen: Pipeline complete — all nodes green]**

"Cache layer means repeat prompts cost zero. Every story, every audio clip — SHA-256 hashed and stored in Turso. No wasted API calls."

## SCENE 5 — THE STORY (Devi, 20s)
**[Screen: Story Player — French text, watercolour illustration, audio controls]**

"Sophie et la Baleine de Nuages. Six scenes. Watercolour illustrations. And listen…"

**[FRENCH AUDIO PLAYS — 10 seconds of ElevenLabs narration]**

"That's ElevenLabs Multilingual v2. One of twenty-nine languages. Jerry, our ElevenAgents concierge, helps parents find the perfect voice."

## SCENE 6 — THE LIBRARY (Anansi, 15s)
**[Screen: Story Library — grid of stories across languages with flags]**

"Eighteen stories across ten languages. English, French, Japanese, Hindi, Arabic, Korean — every story personalised with the child's name and world. Stories belong to everyone."

## SCENE 7 — CLOSE (Papa Bois, 15s)
**[Screen: Team composite — 6 mythology animals]**

"Seven ElevenLabs tools. Mistral Agents API orchestrating four AI agents. LoRA fine-tuning benchmarked with Pixtral as judge. Turso cloud database. All built in thirty-six hours by Team ClawCutters. Bonne nuit, Sophie."
