# Sandman Tales v2 — Demo Script v2 (2 min)

**DOC [0:00-0:30]: PROBLEM**
*"Bedtime’s broken. Parents exhausted. Kids glued to screens. Stories? Generic, forgettable. No magic. No connection. We deserve better."*

**[SCREEN: Parent scrolling TikTok at 9pm, kid watching YouTube. Fade to black.]**

**PATHFINDER [0:30-0:55]: SOLUTION**
*"Sandman Tales fixes this. One prompt—your kid’s name, culture, interests. We generate a unique story, illustrated, narrated. Tonight: Kitsune the fox, for 6-year-old Aya in Tokyo. No screens. Just wonder."*

**[SCREEN: App UI—"Create Story" button. Input: "Aya, 6, Japan, foxes, kindness."]**

**FIREFLY [0:55-1:25]: MOAT**
*"Our stack? Unbeatable. Mistral Agents API orchestrates 4 AI ‘Rangers’—writer, artist, narrator, safety checker—working in parallel. Pixtral auto-QCs illustrations. Voxtral lets parents record their voice. ElevenLabs? 29 languages. Competitors? Stuck in silos. We’re the only ones who scale personalization, safety, and multilingual—fast."*

**LIFELINE [1:25-1:55]: DEMO + FINE-TUNE**
*"Watch. [SCREEN: Watercolor scene 1—Kitsune peeking from bamboo.] ‘Aya, meet Kitsune…’ [Scene 2: Fox helping lost rabbit.] Our first try? FLUX crashed. Switched to Stable Diffusion 1.5—Pixtral rated it 6.8. Then Gemini 9.0. Pipeline’s the hero. [Scene 6: Fox waving under cherry blossoms.] ‘Goodnight, Aya.’"*

**[SCREEN: Full 6-scene story, Japanese narration, parent voice option.]**

*"We fine-tune so you don’t have to."*
