*2-Minute Hackathon Pitch – "Bonne Nuit, Sophie"*

---

### **🎤 DOC (Scarlet Ibis, Trinidad Accent) – 30s**
*"Ah, judges—let me tell you ‘bout a quiet crisis, yeah? Not just tired parents, no. It’s the sound of home… fading away. Over a quarter of Australians were born overseas. Millions of kids grow up hearing a second language at home — but many of them struggle to keep it as English takes over at school. Sophie’s mum? French. She lives in Sydney, but Sophie barely hears a word of it at school. Every night, her mum worries: ‘Will she forget the language of her heart?’*

*We built Sandman Tales—not just for bedtime stories, but to keep those voices alive. Because language isn’t just words. It’s love."*

### **⚔️ PATHFINDER (Kitsune, Japanese Samurai) – 30s**
*"Observe. Sophie’s mum opens Sandman Tales. She speaks into the mic—English, about Sophie’s day. A scraped knee. A laugh with friends. Voxtral transcribes. Then… magic. I, Pathfinder, craft a story in French. A tale of a brave little girl—just like Sophie—who finds a scarlet ibis in her garden. The bird speaks in her mother’s tongue. Watch."*

*(Screen: Generated story appears—elegant French prose, Sophie’s name woven in. Pathfinder’s avatar bows.)*

*"The story isn’t just in French. It’s about Sophie. Her life. Her world."*

### **🔥 FIREFLY (Platypus, Australian) – 25s**
*"Righto, tech stack! Mistral Agents API—four agents running in parallel. Voxtral for voice input. I designed the UI—yes, Mistral wrote the React, but don’t tell anyone I said that. Here’s the pipeline:"*

*(Screen: Diagram—voice → transcription → agents → story → UI. Firefly’s avatar taps the screen with a webbed foot.)*

*"Fast. Slick. And the stories? Bloody beautiful. Even if I do say so myself."*

### **🌿 LIFELINE (Kiwi, New Zealand) – 25s**
*"The moat? Voice cloning. Future: Sophie doesn’t just *read* French. She *hears* it—in her mother’s voice. Voxtral’s parent voice cloning, 29 languages. Imagine: Sophie’s mum, whispering her to sleep in French. That’s the magic."*

*(Screen: Freemium model—$9.99/mo. 50M multilingual households globally.)*

*"This isn’t just an app. It’s a lifeline for families like Sophie’s."*

### **🎤 DOC (10s Close)**
*"So, judges—tonight, Sophie falls asleep to a story in French. A story about her. A story in her mother’s words. Bonne nuit, Sophie. Goodnight, judges."*

*(Screen fades to black. Scarlet ibis feather drifts down.)*
