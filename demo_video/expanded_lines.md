**DOC [0:00-0:30] HOOK + PROBLEM (~75 words):**
You know that moment at bedtime when you’re running on fumes, the kids are glued to a screen, and the stories you read feel… flat? Like they’re missing something? That’s because they are. They’re missing *them*—your child’s laughter, their fears, the little things that make their day unique. Right now, bedtime stories are one-size-fits-none, and parents are left exhausted, craving real connection but too tired to create it. What if bedtime could feel magical again—not just for them, but *for you*?

**PATHFINDER [0:30-1:00] SOLUTION + DEMO SETUP (~75 words):**
Here’s how we fix it. No apps to download, no typing, no complicated setups. Just talk. A parent records a quick voice note about their child’s day using Voxtral—maybe they mention a scraped knee, a favorite animal, or a tough moment at school. Our AI takes it from there, crafting a story that’s *theirs*, illustrated in real time and narrated in their voice—or a voice they love. Tonight, we’re showing you Aya, a six-year-old in Tokyo. Her dad told us she adores foxes and had a rough day. So Mistral created Kitsune, a little fox cub who loses his way but finds his path home by moonlight.

Watch this. You’re seeing the Mistral Agents API in action—each agent handling a piece of the puzzle, passing the baton seamlessly. First, the story engine drafts the narrative, then the illustration agent generates watercolor-style art that feels hand-painted. But the real magic? The voice. ElevenLabs steps in, and in seconds, the story comes alive in Japanese, with all the warmth and rhythm of a parent’s bedtime tale. Listen to this. *[pause for 5 seconds of Japanese audio]* That’s just one of 29 languages we support, with cultural nuances baked in—because a story about a fox in Tokyo should feel different than one in Toronto.

**LIFELINE [1:30-2:00] MOAT + CLOSE (~75 words):**
Here’s why this isn’t just another bedtime app. We’re not just building tech—we’re building trust. Our moat? A growing library of culturally authentic voices, parent-approved data sources, and safety-checked content that adapts as kids grow. Competitors are stuck in silos—static stories, clunky interfaces, or generic AI that doesn’t *get* kids. We scale personalization, safety, and multilingual storytelling *fast*, because every child deserves a story that feels like it was written just for them. This is Sandman Tales. Stories as unique as your child. Goodnight, Aya. Sweet dreams.
