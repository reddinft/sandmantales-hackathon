Milo\u2019s eyes were wide with fear. 'Oh no!' he cried. 'I can\u2019t get out!' Luna\u2019s ears perked up. She knew she had to help her friend.",

        "text": "But just as Luna and Milo were about to head home, a loud *CRACK* echoed through the forest. The ground trembled, and a big, grumpy bear named Bruno appeared! 'Who\u2019s making all this noise?' Bruno growled. Milo trembled, but Luna stood tall. 'We\u2019re sorry, Bruno,' she said bravely. 'We didn\u2019t mean to disturb you.'",

As Bruno lumbered away, Luna turned to Milo. 'Let\u2019s get you home,' she said. Together, they tiptoed through the forest, careful not to make a sound.",
