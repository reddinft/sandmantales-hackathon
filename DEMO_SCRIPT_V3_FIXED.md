**RANGER 1 [0:00]: Hook**
*"Every night, kids drift off to stories… but what if those stories were about THEM?"*
[SCREEN: Cozy bedroom. Aya (5) in bed, eyes wide. Parent holds phone.]

**RANGER 2 [0:15]: The Promise**
*"Meet Sandman Tales v2. Parents speak about their child’s day… and AI turns it into a bedtime story—illustrated, narrated, and safe."*
[SCREEN: Parent taps mic. "Aya loves foxes… had a rough day at school."]

**RANGER 3 [0:25]: Aya’s Throughline**
*"That’s all Dad says. No typing. No prompts. Just Voxtral—our speech-to-text magic."*
[SCREEN: JSON flashes: `{"child": "Aya", "interests": ["foxes"], "mood": "tired"}` → Mistral agents animate.]

**RANGER 4 [0:40]: The Story**
*"Mistral crafts a tale about Kitsune, a fox cub lost in the woods… until moonlight guides him home."*
[SCREEN: Watercolor illustrations bloom—fox under stars, soft brushstrokes.]

**RANGER 1 [1:00]: The Proof**
*"ElevenLabs narrates in 29 languages. Here’s Aya’s story in Japanese:"*
[SCREEN: Aya listens. PLAY 10s of Japanese narration: *"Kitsune wa tsuki no hikari ni michibikarete…"*]

**RANGER 2 [1:20]: The Moat**
*"Cultural adaptation. Parent-voice input. Safety-checked content at scale. No one else does this."*

**Key fixes:**
- **Aya’s throughline** (0:25 → 1:50) is her story, not grief.
- **Voxtral input** is the hero ("Dad just talks").
- **ElevenLabs proof** = actual Japanese audio.
- **Mistral agents** shown via JSON handoff.
- **Tone** stays warm, no detours.
