_Generated by Doc via Mistral Large 3_

**🎤 Sandman Tales v2 – Demo Script (3:00 min)**
*Doc, Galaxy Rangers – Mistral Hackathon Sydney*
*(Trini warmth, playful energy, eye contact with judges)*

**[0:00 - 0:20] OPENING: EMOTION**
*(SCREEN: Black. Soft lullaby music fades in. A single watercolor star twinkles.)*

**DOC:**
*"Alright, judges… close your eyes for three seconds. Imagine you’re five years old again. The lights dim. Your parent leans in, voice warm like sunlight through leaves. They don’t just read you a story—they* build *one… just for you. A tale where* you’re *the hero, where your fears become fireflies, where the monsters under the bed… turn out to be friendly dragons. That’s Sandman Tales."*

*(SCREEN: Title slide – "Sandman Tales v2" in watercolor script. Fade to live demo.)*

**[0:21 - 0:50] DEMO: THE PIPELINE (ENGLISH STORY)**
*(SCREEN: Parent dashboard. "Create Story" button pulses.)*

**DOC:**
*"Let’s make magic. Parent voice input—Voxtral listens. ‘My child loves dinosaurs but hates loud noises.’ Boom. Mistral Large 3’s* **Doc Agent** *crafts a JSON story skeleton: hero, conflict, resolution. Then* **Pathfinder** *plots the emotional arc—no scary roars, just gentle rumbles. Firefly* *paints the words into watercolor prompts for Imagen 4.0. And Lifeline?* *That’s our safety net—checking for bias, ensuring every kid feels seen."*

*(SCREEN: JSON output flashes briefly. Then: Imagen generates a watercolor T-Rex wearing noise-canceling headphones. ElevenLabs narrates in a soothing British voice:)*
**ELEVENLABS (AI):**
*"Once, in a valley of whispering ferns, there lived a dinosaur named Thunder… who was afraid of his own echo."*

*(SCREEN: Storybook UI unfolds—illustrations animate slightly as narration plays.)*

**DOC:**
*"See that? No generic fairy tales. This is* **personalized therapy** *disguised as bedtime. And it’s not just English—watch this."*

**[0:51 - 1:20] DEMO: MULTILINGUAL MAGIC**
*(SCREEN: Language dropdown. Select Japanese. Parent input: "子供は星が怖いです。")*

**DOC:**
*"Same pipeline, new tongue. Voxtral transcribes. Mistral’s agents adapt—cultural nuances matter. Imagen swaps watercolor styles: softer brushstrokes for Japanese aesthetics. And ElevenLabs? Twelve languages, zero loss in warmth."*

*(SCREEN: Watercolor night sky with a shy star. Narration in Japanese, voice trembling slightly:)*
**ELEVENLABS (AI):**
*"星のソラは、自分の光が強すぎて、みんなを起こしてしまうのではないかと心配していました…"*
*(Translation: "Star Sora worried her light was too bright—what if she woke everyone up?")*

**DOC:**
*"Same story, different heart. Now… let’s talk about the* **hard choices** *behind the magic."*

**[1:21 - 2:30] THE FINE-TUNE EXPERIMENT: ENGINEERING HONESTY**
*(SCREEN: Split view. Left: LoRA training logs (OOM errors). Right: Pixtral’s 8.6/10 scorecard.)*

**DOC:**
*"We tried to fine-tune FLUX.1-schnell—12B parameters on a Mac Mini. Crashed harder than a toddler after sugar. Pivoted to Stable Diffusion 1.5, trained 500 steps on 20 Imagen images. Pixtral judged the output: 8.6/10. Impressive… but the teacher—Imagen—still won. So we made a call: *quality over ego.*"*

*(SCREEN: Side-by-side comparison. Left: SD 1.5’s "muddy" dragon. Right: Imagen’s vibrant, detailed dragon.)*

**DOC (pointing):**
*"This isn’t failure—it’s* **engineering maturity***. The innovation isn’t the model; it’s the* **pipeline***. We could’ve shipped the ‘good enough’ dragon. But Sandman Tales isn’t about ‘good enough.’ It’s about* **safe, beautiful, personal** *stories that help kids sleep. So we chose the path that lets parents trust us."*

*(SCREEN: FastAPI/React architecture diagram—simple, modular, scalable.)*

**[2:31 - 2:55] CLOSING: THE BIGGER PICTURE**
*(SCREEN: Three storybook covers—English, Japanese, French—floating like constellations.)*

**DOC:**
*"This isn’t just a demo. It’s a* **moonshot for childhood***. Imagine refugee kids hearing stories in their native tongue, or neurodivergent children getting tales tailored to their sensory needs. We’re not just building a product; we’re* **reclaiming bedtime** *from screens and stress."*

*(SCREEN: Final slide—"Sandman Tales: Where every child is the hero." Contact info + QR code.)*

**DOC (softly, like a lullaby):**
*"So judges… which kid’s story should we tell next? Yours?"*

*(SCREEN: Black. A single watercolor star fades out. Applause.)*

**[3:00] END.**

**🎯 Why this works:**
- **Emotion first** (judges remember how you made them *feel*).
- **Tech as a character** (agents have personalities; pipeline is the hero).
- **Engineering honesty** (shows depth, trustworthiness).
- **Trini flair** (warmth + humor = memorable).
